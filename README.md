1.PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Student performance is influenced by multiple academic and behavioural factors.
Faculty may find it difficult to identify students who are at risk at an early stage.
A data-driven system can help predict student performance.
The system can provide recommendations for improving student outcomes.

2. Proposed Solution:
Collect student-related information.
Process the entered data.
Use a Machine Learning model to predict performance.
Classify students based on predicted performance.
Generate intelligent recommendations.
Display the results through a user-friendly Tkinter interface.

4. Project Mapping:
V-Model Stage	Smart Student Project
Requirement Analysis	Identify student performance problem
System Design	Design system architecture and UI
Implementation	Develop Python + ML application
Integration	Integrate UI, ML and AI
Testing	Test individual modules and complete system
Validation	Check system against requirements
Demonstration	Present working capstone

5. Project – Modular Application Development:
Create separate functions:
get_student_data()
calculate_average()
calculate_performance()
display_result()

6. Requirement Analysis:
Identify the User
Primary users may include:
Faculty,
Academic coordinators,
Mentors,
Students.

7. User Requirement:
The user should be able to:
Enter student information.
Submit the information for analysis.
View predicted performance.
Understand the student's risk level.
Receive improvement recommendations.

8. Identify System Inputs:
The initial system can use:
Student ID
Student name
Attendance percentage
Study hours per day
Internal assessment marks
Assignment completion percentage
Previous academic performance
Example:
Parameter	Example
Attendance	82%
Study Hours	4 hours/day
Internal Marks	76%
Assignment Completion	90%
Previous Performance	72%

9. Identify System Outputs:
Performance Prediction
Excellent
Good
Average
At Risk

10. Additional Output:
Prediction score/probability
Risk level
Key factors affecting performance
Recommended actions
Example:
Prediction: Good Performance
Risk Level: Low
Recommendation: Maintain current study pattern and attendance

11. Functional Requirements:
The system should:
Accept student details.
Validate user inputs.
Store/process student information.
Preprocess input data.
Apply the trained ML model.
Predict student performance.
Generate recommendations.
Display results through the GUI.
Handle invalid inputs.
Provide a reset/clear option.

12. Non-Functional Requirements
The application should be:
User-friendly
Easy to understand
Fast in generating predictions
Reliable
Maintainable
Scalable
Secure with respect to student data
Easy to test
